# SDOK

Spontaneous Display of Knowledge: A quiz i have gvien for my last 2 phase 3's
as a quick assessment of where the cohort was weak.  Check the git log to see
my solutions for the SDOK.

* We do not do question 4 as it's covered in the [rails guide]()
* "Loneliness" answer: `[#<Friend id: 11, sex: "F", name: "Ray Dooley", country: "Russia", age: 51, iq: 191>]`

Otherwise, consult the git log.
